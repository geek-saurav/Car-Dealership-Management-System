# Car Dealership Management System

This is a system designed for car dealerships to manage their operations effectively. The system is aimed at providing a seamless experience for both employees and customers.

## Project Outline

This application is designed for employees and customers who can access information from the database about car deals. The system's objective is to automate executives' and administrators' work with minimal effort. For example, they can generate quotations for any car inquiry in no time. Additionally, the system can capture customer feedback regarding the showroom services.

## Project Goals

The system should be capable of performing the following:

- Store basic information about cars, employees, customers, accessories, and services provided by the organization.
- Store salary information of employees such as working hours, salary per hour, salary before tax, tax percentage, total amount of tax paid, salary after tax, social security fee, on a monthly basis.
- Help employees automate the billing process by quickly fetching car/accessory details from the database.
- Generate invoices and maintain transaction details.
- List the inventory of cars currently available in a dealership.
- Help customers access car details such as model, make, engine no., price, etc.
- Help the organization maintain customer details like customer name, transaction/purchase details, car purchased, purchase medium, purchase date, etc.
- Display details of various dealerships of the same franchise/organization like profits, dealership name, number of cars in the dealership, number of employees, etc.

### Development Model

The system development model will follow the Waterfall model. The different phases are as follows:

- Requirement Analysis: Capture all possible requirements of the system to be developed and document them in a requirement specification document.
- Design Stage: Study the requirement specifications from the first phase and prepare the system design. This system design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and helps in defining the overall system architecture.
- Implementation: Develop the system in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is referred to as Unit Testing.
- Integration and Testing: All the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post-integration, the entire system is tested for any faults and failures.
- Deployment of System: Once the functional and non-functional testing is done, the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.
- Maintenance: Issues that come up in the client environment are fixed by releasing patches. To enhance the product, better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.
- In this model, phases do not overlap, and progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards like a waterfall. The next phase is started only after the defined set of goals are achieved for the previous phase and signed off.
